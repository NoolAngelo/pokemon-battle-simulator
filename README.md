This Kotlin program is a simple text-based game where a player can choose a character and engage in a battle with an enemy named Badang. The game continues until either the player or Badang's health reaches zero.

At the start of the program, two global variables badangHealth and playerHealth are declared and initialized to 1000, representing the health points of Badang and the player's character, respectively.

The main function begins by displaying a list of characters that the player can choose from: Ash, Brock, or Misty. The player's choice is read from the console input and stored in the userInput variable. If the input is not null, a when statement is used to handle the player's choice. If the player chooses "brock", the game enters a loop where the Brock function is repeatedly called until either the player's or Badang's health drops to zero or below. If the player's health reaches zero first, the game prints "Game Over!". If Badang's health reaches zero first, the game prints "Badang is dead, yehey!".

The Brock function represents the actions that the player can take when they choose Brock as their character. It first prints some information about the enemy and the player's character, including their health and skills. The player is then prompted to select an attack. The chosen attack is read from the console input and used in a when statement to determine the damage dealt to Badang. After the player's attack, if Badang's health is still above zero, the badangAttack function is called, representing Badang's counterattack.

The attack function takes an integer argument representing the damage to be dealt to Badang. It subtracts this damage from Badang's health and then prints the damage dealt and Badang's remaining health. If the damage causes Badang's health to drop below zero, it is set to zero to prevent negative health values.

The badangAttack function represents Badang's attack on the player. It randomly selects an attack damage from a list and subtracts this damage from the player's health. It then prints the damage dealt and the player's remaining health. Similar to the attack function, if the damage causes the player's health to drop below zero, it is set to zero to prevent negative health values.
