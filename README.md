This Kotlin program is a simple text-based game where a player can choose a character and engage in a battle with an enemy named Badang. The game continues until either the player or Badang's health reaches zero.

At the start of the program, two global variables badangHealth and playerHealth are declared and initialized to 1000, representing the health points of Badang and the player's character, respectively.

The main function begins by displaying a list of characters that the player can choose from: Ash, Brock, or Misty. The player's choice is read from the console input and stored in the userInput variable. If the input is not null, a when statement is used to handle the player's choice. If the player chooses "brock", the game enters a loop where the Brock function is repeatedly called until either the player's or Badang's health drops to zero or below. If the player's health reaches zero first, the game prints "Game Over!". If Badang's health reaches zero first, the game prints "Badang is dead, yehey!".
